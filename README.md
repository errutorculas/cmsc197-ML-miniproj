# Forcasting Energy Consumption in the Philippines Using Machine Learning Algorithms

### Erru Torculas, Earl James Rentillo, Brethren Ace dela Gente


**Abstract.** In the Philippines, usage of energy has been steadily increasing over the years, however, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about unforeseen changes to these parameters. By using machine learning algorithms, energy predictions can be more properly assessed, and corresponding measures can be put into place. The Monthly and Quarterly Market Assessment Report of Wholesale Electricity Spot Market(WESM), governed by Philippines Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC)â€™s data was analyzed using four machine learning algorithms, namely, Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVR, and XGBoost to determine the best algorithm in predicting energy consumption within the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Running these algorithms on the dataset through the Scikit-learn Python library, it was found that the Pre-pandemic (Period 1) data was most accurately predicted by the XGBoost model, having an RMSE of 366.691 and MAPE of 0.044, while the Pandemic (Period 2) data was most accurately predicted by the Random Forest Model from its RMSE of 687.665 and MAPE of 0.061. The poorest performing model for both these periods was the SVR, getting an RMSE of 431.366 and 982.202 to the respective periods. The results show how developing predictive models from XGBoost and Random Forest Models is significant to forecasting energy consumption in the Philippines, and is therefore also beneficial for future studies that aim to engage in the same context.


## Dataset

The data used throughout this project is consolidated data from 2014 to the second quarter of 2022 of the [Monthly and Quarterly Market Assessment Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yxtk9GNx4CCfY3Eh4bY19_5nwx5HcVbw?usp=share_link) of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) governed by the Philippines Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC). Also, the Department of Energy 2020 Summary Power Statistics was also utilized as a basis for Power Consumption by Sector, specifically, the Commercial and Industrial data.
